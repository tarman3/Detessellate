## What It Does

Finds problems automatically and assists the user in fixing them through a 4-tab docker interface:
- **Zero-Length Lines** - Zero length lines are discovered and optionally deleted.
- **Duplicate Geometry** - Overlapping geometry are discovered and optionally deleted.
- **Non-Coincident Vertices** - Finds missing coincident constraints and can apply all or one at a time.
- **Wire Topology Issues** - Finds floating, intersecting, T-junctions, bridges, & subdivisions, and facilitates conversion to construction geometry. 

## Features

- Visual highlighting of candidate edges and vertices with 8 highlight color choices
- One-click automated fixes
- Safe operations with rollback (transaction-enabled undo enries)
- Works with B-splines and complex sketches
