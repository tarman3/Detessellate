## 🛠️ SketchReProfile — Reconstructed Geometry for FreeCAD Sketches

**SketchReProfile** is a FreeCAD macro that reconstructs clean sketch geometry — circles, arcs, B-splines, and lines — from tessellated construction edges. It’s optimized for post-processing sketches generated by the **CoplanarSketch** macro, using deterministic logic and minimal user input to recover intended geometric features from mesh-derived data.

### 🔍 Features

- **Circle Detection**: Equilateral polygon → circumcircle with radius constraint  
- **Arc Fitting**: Partial equilateral polygon → proper arcs  
- **Spline Generation**: Smooth angular transitions → interpolating B-splines  
- **Line Simplification**: Colinear segments → single lines  
- **Topology Repair**: Endpoint constraints and edge toggling for wire integrity  
- **One-Click Operation**: No dialogs, no manual selection, rollback-safe

### ⚙️ Requirements

- FreeCAD **v1.0.2 stable**  
- Windows (tested)  
- Sketcher Workbench  
- Python 3 with NumPy (typically bundled)

### 📦 Installation

1. Place `SketchReProfile.py` in your FreeCAD macros directory  
2. Restart FreeCAD or refresh the macro list

### 🧪 Testing Status

Initial release under a new versioning system.  
**Only tested on Windows with FreeCAD v1.0.2** — Linux/macOS testers welcome.
