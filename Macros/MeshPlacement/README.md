A FreeCAD macro to position one or more selected meshes or solids at the global origin based on their bounding box.  
This tool provides a dock widget with intuitive buttons to **center** or **align** meshes along X, Y, Z axes (or combinations like XY, XYZ). It works on single or multiple selected meshes, with undo safety and a clean UI layout.
